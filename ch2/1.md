The language I like is rust.

The rustc source code can be find here, [rustc repo](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust).


[The guide to rustc development](https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/compiler-src.html) is helpful for poking around the compiler.


The code for the scanner, aka lexer can be found here: [rustc-lexer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/compiler/rustc_lexer). However, lexing has been seperated into two stages. The first, linked above is meant to be re-usable and does not include rust-specific concerns. Output from `rustc_parse::lexer`'s output is ready for the parse stage. The rustc_lexer can be found here: [rustc_parse::lexer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/compiler/rustc_parse/src/lexer)


The documentation for the scanner can be found here: [rustc-lexer documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lexer/index.html).

The code for the parser can be find here: [rustc_parser](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/compiler/rustc_parse/src/parser).
