Q: Just-in-time compilation tends to be the fastest way to implement dynamically typed languages, but not all of them use it. What reasons are there to not JIT?

Some reasons to not implement JIT:
* it's another thing to code so takes more time, aka you have to code a compiler
* computer resource limitations, it's more code to run, on a resource constrained system there may not be space, this assumes that it takes more computer resources to run compiler + interpreter.
* maybe you can't afford to wait & it's more important that the program begin executing sooner vs it executing faster. Aka, latency is more important than throughput. I can't think of a reason for this to matter.
